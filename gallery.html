<h3>Raster Image Art</h3>
<img src="images/SandraCabanas_Selfie600px.jpg" alt="raster image" width="400px">
<p>This raster image was created in Adobe Photoshop and it has an image of a place that I visited with my family. I took a picture because of the way the building made it look like a garden even though it was in the big city. I decided that I wanted to select some parts of the background with different colors to show how the image looks under different effect or lights.</p>
<h4>Vector Image Art</h4>
<img src="images/SandraCabanas_vector_600px.png" alt="vector cat" width="400px">
<p>This is a vector image that I made using the rectangle tool and eclipse tool to create a cat. I wanted to make either a dog or cat, so I started with a cat to represent my avatar.</p>

<h5>Christmas Audio </h5>

</audio>
<p> The moment that I wanted to represent with this sound was a busy christmas street with last minute shopping. In the beginning I wanted a person to be walking out of the subway station, into the busy streets of the city. Where christmas music was all around and people were buying presents last minute. </p>

<h6>Funny Gif</h6>

<img src="images/Sandra_gif.gif" alt="gif_monkey" width="400px">
<p>I decided to make a GIF with the help of Adobe Illustrator. I created a monkey and wanted to show how the monkey was happy playing around but then he dropped one of his bananas. Also creating the frames was hard because I had to move things in a certain way to get them to look how I wanted them to.</p>
