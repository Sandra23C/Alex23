<h3>Raster Image Art</h3>
<img src="images/SandraCabanas_Selfie600px.jpg" alt="raster image" width="400px">
<p>This raster image was created in Adobe Photoshop and it has an image of a place that I visited with my family. I took a picture because of the way the building made it look like a garden even though it was in the big city. I decided that I wanted to select some parts of the background with different colors to show how the image looks under different effect or lights.</p>
<h3>Vector Image Art</h3>
<img src="images/SandraCabanas_vector_600px.png" alt="vector cat" width="400px">
<p>This is a vector image that I made using the rectangle tool and eclipse tool to create a cat. I wanted to make either a dog or cat, so I started with a cat to represent my avatar.</p></br>

<h3>Christmas Audio </h3>

  <source src="SandraAudio.mp3">
</audio>
<br></br>
<p> The moment that I wanted to represent with this sound was a busy christmas street with last minute shopping. In the beginning I wanted a person to be walking out of the subway station, into the busy streets of the city. Where christmas music was all around and people were buying presents last minute. </p><br></br>

<h3>Funny Gif</h3>

<img src="images/Sandra_gif.gif" alt="gif_monkey" width="400px">
<p>I decided to make a GIF with the help of Adobe Illustrator. I created a monkey and wanted to show how the monkey was happy playing around but then he dropped one of his bananas.Also creating the frames was hard because I had to move things in a certain way to get them to look how I wanted them to.</p><br></br>

<h3>Dream effect </h3>

<p>I wanted to create the moment in which I was in a boat but in reality, I was dreaming and moving back and forward, so I was going to fall on the bed. </p>
