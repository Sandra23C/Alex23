<h4>Organ donation is a processs in where a organ is donated to a person who needs the organ because one of their organ is failing and the only option is a organ transplant. Healthy people can choose to donate certain organs when they are alive such as a kidney, since people are able to live with just one kidney. A small portion of the liver can also be donated, since the liver is able to grow back. In order to be able to donate a organ a person must be over 18 years old and register to be a donor and a driver license is needed to fill out the form. However if depends on the state that the person lives in. A Organ Procurement Organiztion checks the person's status regarding if they register to donate their organs and they also contact the organ Procurement and Transplantatiom Network(OPTN).<br><br>Some Organs or tissuses that can be donated are listed below: <br>-Heart <br>-Liver<br>-Kidney<br>   -Lungs<br>-Corneas<br>-Bone marrow<br><br>
