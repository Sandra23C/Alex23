<h2>Raster Image Art</h2>
<img src="images/SandraCabanas_Selfie600px.jpg" alt="raster image" width="400px">
<p>This raster image was created in Adobe Photoshop and it has an image of a place that I visited with my family. I took a picture because of the way the building made it look like a garden even though it was in the big city. I decided that I wanted to select some parts of the background with different colors to show how the image looks under different effect or lights.</p>
<h3>Vector Image Art</h3>
<img src="images/SandraCabanas_vector_600px.png" alt="vector cat" width="400px">
<p>This is a vector image that I made using the rectangle tool and eclipse tool to create a cat. I wanted to make either a dog or cat, so I started with a cat to represent my avatar.</p>
